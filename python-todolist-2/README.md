### WELCOME TO THE PROJECT REPORT ####

1. Project Overview
This program is designed to be a to-do list performed solely on a command-line interface (CLI) if ported as a .exe file OR within a terminal of a Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code.

It's current purpose is to just store tasks and/or activities the user needs to complete, and present it to them in a ordered list format.

I created this program because I always use a to-do list myself in my day-to-day life and wish to discover how they are programmed.

It's current features include:
- Adding tasks to the to-do list
- Showing the total list of tasks, it's description and status
- Marking tasks as complete
- Deleting tasks, whether they're incomplete or complete
- Exiting the program
