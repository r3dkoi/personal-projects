Tracking and managing study habits is a valuable skill that supports
academic success and personal development. 

In this project, users will be allowed to log study sessions,
categorise time spent by subject and activity type, and generate
summaries of their progress. 

This system encourages self-reflection,
goal-setting, and consistent learning routinesâ€”key behaviours that
support UN Sustainable Development Goal 4: Quality Education, by
promoting effective lifelong learning practices.
