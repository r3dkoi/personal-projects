2. Show Tasks
3. Mark tasks as done
4. Delete tasks
5. Exit
Enter your choice: 
-----------------------------------------------------------
#Adding tasks section
            
IF choice is "1" 
PRINT the following:
    CREATE n_tasks and STORE as a INTEGER "How many tasks you want to add: "
    //depending on user number input, it'll keep going to add as many tasks as they want
    
    FOR i in RANGE of n_tasks 
        CREATE task and STORE input "Enter the task: "
        CREATE tasks and APPEND task as a DICTIONARY "task: , "done": false
       
        //It becomes a dictionary due to the key:value pair - the task and then the input of said task.
        //by adding bool to the done key, it states that it's Not Done / false.

//Once loop finishes, return to main Menu
------------------------------------------------------------
#Show tasks function
// Sorted in descending order 
// Shows tasks that arent done and are done
// Shows tasks that haven't been deleted

ELIF choice is 2
    PRINT "\nTasks:"
    // Sets the tasks in a new line

    FOR index, task in enumerate(tasks):
    //enumerate(tasks) generates pairs of (index, task) 
    // for each item in the tasks list []
    // index is the index position
    // task is the dictionary containing the
    //  task details (gotten from the adding tasks section)

        CREATE status and STORE "Done"
            IF task["done"] else "Not Done"
            //Checks the value of task: done
            // if task["done"] is True, sets status to "Done"
            // if task["done"] is False, sets status to "Not Done"

        FOR each task in the list of tasks:
            Calculate the current index plus 1
            Retrieve the task description from current task
            Get the status of the current task
            PRINT the index, task description, and status in the desired format.
